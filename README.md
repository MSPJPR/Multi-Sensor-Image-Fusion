Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a web-based platform that allows users to fuse images from different sensors (e.g., visible light, infrared, edge-detected) using various image fusion techniques. This project demonstrates real-time image processing capabilities and multi-sensor fusion methods in an accessible, browser-based interface.

Key Features

1. Upload and Preview Images:

Users can upload two images (e.g., RGB, infrared) to the platform.

The images are displayed for preview before fusion.



2. Fusion Techniques:

Fusion methods like Average Fusion and Gradient-Based Fusion.

Dynamic selection of fusion techniques through the interface.



3. Real-Time Processing:

Immediate image fusion without server-side processing.

All operations handled within the browser using JavaScript.



4. Download Results:

Users can download the fused image in standard formats (e.g., PNG).



5. Responsive UI Design:

Mobile-friendly interface with modern CSS styling.

Easy-to-use controls for selecting and applying fusion techniques.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structure and layout of the web application.

CSS: Styling for a clean and responsive design.

JavaScript: Core logic for image uploading, processing, and fusion.

How It Works

1. Upload Phase:

The user uploads two images through input fields.



2. Fusion Processing:

The user selects a fusion method from a dropdown menu.

JavaScript processes the images and applies the selected fusion technique.



3. Display Results:

The fused image is shown on the screen.

Users can download the fused image.

Applications

1. Surveillance and Security:

Combining visible light and thermal imagery for better scene understanding.



2. Medical Imaging:

Fusing CT and MRI images for more comprehensive diagnosis.



3. Remote Sensing:

Merging satellite images captured in different spectral bands.



4. Autonomous Vehicles:

Using multi-sensor fusion for object detection and navigation.
